Why the need for this?

John is running fast because John is trying to catch the train.
Instead, we write
John is running fast because he is trying to catch the train.

this keyword is used as a shortcut and it refers to the subject in context
or the subjct of the executing code.

var person = {

firstName: "Penelope",
lastName: "Barrymore",

fullName:function(){

console.log(this.firstName);
console.log(person.firstName);//instead of this, we can also write like this

}
}

if we have another global variable person, then using person.firstName can 
lead to confusion. In order to minimize this problem, we use the this keyword.

The this keyword not only refers to the object but it also contains the value
of the object.
