Objects:

Data types in JS can be classified into two types - primitive(string, null, numbers, boolean and undefined) 
and reference (objects). Primitive are immutable whereas objects are mutable. An object is an unordered list of name-value
pairs made of primitive and reference data types (functions and objects within objects). Each item in the list is called a 
property and functions within objects are called methods.

Example: 

var myFirstObject = 

    {

    firstName: "Richard", 
    lastName: "Burke"
    
    };
    
    
Property names can be strings or numbers, if numbers then they must be accessed by bracket notation.

Example:

var ageGroup = {

   20: "joe",
   30: "mary"
   
   };
   
console.log(ageGroup["30"]); //will print mary
console.log(ageGroup.30); // will throw error

Pass by value vs Pass by reference:

One of the main differences between the reference data types and primitive data types is that reference data types
values are stored as reference and not directly on the variable, as a value, as the primitive data types.

Pass by value:

var person = "Joe"; The primitive data type string is stored as a value directly on the variable person.
var anotherPerson = person; //anotherPerson = value of person
person = "Bryant"; //value of person changed

console.log(anotherPerson) // Joe
console.log(person); // Bryant

Pass by reference:

var person = {name:"kobe"};
var anotherPerson = person;
person.name = "Joe";
console.log(person.name); //Joe
console.log(anotherPerson.name); //Joe

Here, when the person object is copied to the anotherPerson object, what is happening is that the person object is stored
as a reference and not directly as a value. So, both person 


Creating Objects:

There are 2 ways to creating objects - object literals and object constructors

Object literal:

var myBooks = {}; //empty object initialized using object literal notation
var myBio = {

 name: "Joe",
 age: 38,
 job: "developer"
};

Object constructor: A constructor is a function that initializes new objects and we use the new keyword to call 
this constructor. 

example:

var mango = new Object();
mango.name = "joe";
mango.age = 34;

mango.count = function(){
console.log("Hi");
}

Objects, apart from containing numbers, strings and methods, can also contain other objects as properties.

What to do when you have to create repetitive tasks? Such as, you need to make a display of 10 fruits, each containing
same list of properties. Instead of creating 10 different fruit objects, you can use either the constructor pattern
or the prototype pattern to create a new object that has the same properties of another object.

1. Constructor pattern for creating objects: (this pattern uses the new keyword , so it is called constructor pattern)

function Fruit(theColor,theSweetness,theFruitname){

this.color = theColor;
this.sweetness = theSweetness;
this.fruitName = theFruitname;

this.showName = function(){
console.log(this.fruitName);
}

}

var mangoFruit = new Fruit("yellow",8,"mango");
mangoFruit.showName(); //mango

var orangeFruit = new Fruit("orange-red",8,"orange");
orangeFruit.showName(); //orange

This constructor pattern encapsulates all the functionalities and characteristics of all the fruits in by making 
just the single Fruit function with inheritance.


2. Prototype pattern for creating Objects:

function Fruit(){}

Fruit.prototype.color = "Yellow";
Fruit.prototype.sweetness = 7;
Fruit.prototype.fruitName = "Mango";

Fruit.prototype.showName = function(){
console.log(this.fruitName);
}

var mangoFruit = new Fruit();
