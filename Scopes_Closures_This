Closures:



 var person = {
    firstName: "Penelope",
    lastName: "Barrymore",
    fullName: function () {
    
 // Since the "this" keyword is used inside the showFullName method below, and the showFullName method is defined on the person object,
 // "this" will have the value of the person object because the person object will invoke showFullName ()â€‹
 
        console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
        console.log(person.firstName + " " + person.lastName);
    }
}

All functions in JS have properties, just like how objects have properties, and functions get the this property - a variable
with the value of the object that invokes the function where this is used.

When we use this in a global function, the object this refers to is the global window object.
